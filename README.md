# CodeAcademy-Machine-Learning-In-Python-Project-Predicting-Income-Using-Random-Forest
In this project, I used the dataset containing census information based in year 1994 from UCI’s Machine Learning Repository.  By using this census data with a random forest, we will try to predict whether or not a person makes more than $50,000 a year as income.
